# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
**M4:**
- February 12, 2025: We modified our use cases to the following: Manage Trip, View Past Trips, View Recipes, View Groceries, Manage Account and Manage Discounts. The updated use-case diagram is:  
![Use-Case Diagram](images/use-case-diagram-v2.png)  
The reason for changing our diagram is based on comments from our M3. We also removed the "Share on Social Media" use case for the MVP since we didnâ€™t think we would have enough time, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 12, 2025: Based on feedback from our M3, we added live updates through push notifications with Firebase. Every time a new discount is pushed by a grocery store, users subscribed to discount updates will receive a push notification about the discount.
- February 26, 2025: Another change was made to the preferences option for "Manage Trip." This feature has been de-scoped for the MVP, so it is not included, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 27, 2025: Several changes were made to the databases. The new databases we now have are: geonames, route_data, food_data and discounts. The purpose of the geonames database is to store all cities with a population greater than 15,000 people in order to generate routes to these cities. We switched to this approach instead of using an API, as the API was unreliable and the server was often down. We also decided to remove the users database since we de-scoped preferences. It seemed better to separate routes and recipes for portability. Additionally, we got rid of the groceries database and now use the recipes database for ingredients.
**M5:**
- March 16, 2025
    - Section 2: added more clarity of virtual trips and removed descoped features(social media)
    - Section 3.1: Updated use case diagram to more accurately reflect relationships between use cases (View Recipes must use View Past Trips, Manage Groceries must use View Recipes.)
    - Section 3.2:

## 2. Project Description
FoodTrip is an android app that helps users explore global cuisines by planning a virtual food trip. Users can choose a starting and ending country, and the app will generate a travel route with recipes from different locations along the way. It also creates a smart grocery list which can be used to optimize ingredient reuse and allow users to see local store discounts. Additionally, FoodTrip allows dietary preference customization and social media sharing, so users can tailor their meals to their needs and share their journeys with friends.

            - **Input**: Asks for location permissions if they are not already given. An interface selecting which grocery list the user would like to plan a trip for. 
            - **Output**: A Google Maps route starting at the users' location and passing through local grocery stores. The user has a button to generate a different route if needed
        4. Manage_Grocery_List
            - **Purpose**: Allows the user to issue AJAX requests to change the ingredients on a given grocery list, retrieved and updating the groceries database
            - **Input**: A screen displaying a list of ingredients and their quantity, with buttons to adjust the quantity, add or remove ingredients
            - **Output**: Whether or not a given operation was successful

### **4.2. Databases**
1. **[Users]**
    - **Purpose**: Stores user account information, including authentication details, dietary preferences, saved trips, and any personalized settings
2. **[Trips]**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all trips for a given user and the recipes used in that trip
3. **[Groceries]**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all grocery lists for a given user

### **4.3. External Modules**
1. **[Edamam API]** 
    - **Purpose**: Used to lookup recipes. Chosen for its ability to lookup 2.3 million recipes and 30 day free trial, as well as being utilized in other similar use cases requiring recipe lookup
2. **[Google Maps]** 
    - **Purpose**: Used for creating virtual trips and planning local grocery trips. Chosen for its popularity and abundant support/documentation
3. **[Meta API]** 
    - **Purpose**: Used to share recipes used in a virtual trip, the route taken in a virtual trip, or pictures of the food that users have made to a Meta platform(Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.)


### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **AWS**
    - **Purpose**: EC2 Instance
    - **Reason**: All team members have prior experience with AWS from M1. We are also familiar with setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the backend whenever changes are made to the main branch.
2. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Databases
    - **Reason**: All team members have experience working with MongoDB, and it is an approved framework for the project. We also have hands-on experience from tutorials on setting up the database and integrating it with our backend.
3. **Node.js & Express**
    - **Purpose**: Backend API
    - **Reason**: All members are familiar with it, and it meets the project requirements. It also integrates well with MongoDB.

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [Efficient performance](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: The system will use caching and asynchronous processing to improve response times. Frequently accessed data will be cached to reduce redundant computations, and background tasks will handle complex operations without blocking user interactions.
2. [Scalability](#nfr1)
    - **Cloud Computing**: The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud services and thus be able to dynamically scale to meet the needs of users. Recipes will be stored by name or ID on a MongoDB database, thus reducing their overall size from the entire recipe to just a list of strings, thus drastically reducing the size of recipes

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**[Convert_Virtual_Trip]**
- **Description**: Converts a virtual trip from google maps into a list of ingredients. Formally, it takes a pair of coordinates and finds a combination of transportation methods between those points via google maps. Must be able to associate the path travelled to certain ethnic foods, then search for recipes for said food through edamam API, finally returning a series of recipes that an individual may reasonably find if they were to actually travel between the two inputs points. A dish would be considered reasonable if the region associated with it is within a certain distance of a virtual path between the points as given by google maps. The user may specify dietary restrictions and the number of subcultures within a given country, which would be relevant as it may arbitrarily restrict the recipes that are associated with the selected virtual path
- **Why complex?**: Since users are expected to travel across multiple countries, many different paths could be taken depending on the forms of transportation available, meaning that there are many different viable virtual paths. For any given virtual path, the algorithm must be able to determine what recipes are associated with that path, and then find a combination of recipes that satisfies the number of dishes per country whilst obeying user dietary restrictions
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: firstpoint, The starting location of the virtual trip
                secondpoint, The end location of the virtual trip
                stops_per_country, the number of dishes to select per country
                 dietary_restrictions, a list of ingredients to avoid
    - **Output**: a list of recipes associated with the virtual path between input points
    - **Main computational logic**: ...
    - **Pseudo-code**: ...
        ```
        attempted_paths = 0
        viable_routes = []
        recipes = []
        countries = []
        while (attemptedpaths < attempt_limit) // to prevent insane delays from trying every possible path
            route = find_route(firstpoint, secondpoint)
            countries = find_countries_from_route(route)
            for country in countries
                potential_recipes = find_recipes_for_country(route,country,relevance_distance)
                remove_violating_recipes(potential_recipes, dietary_restrictions)
                if potential_recipes.length < stops_per_country
                    continue // try another path
                selected_recipes = select_recipes(potential_recipes, stops_per_country, subcultures_per_country)
                recipes.add(selected_recipes)
                viable_routes.add(route)
            attemptedpaths++
        return(recipes,viable_routes)
        ```
