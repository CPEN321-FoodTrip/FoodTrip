# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
**M4:**
- February 12, 2025: We modified our use cases to the following: Manage Trip, View Past Trips, View Recipes, View Groceries, Manage Account and Manage Discounts.
The reason for changing our diagram is based on comments from our M3. We also removed the "Share on Social Media" use case for the MVP since we didnâ€™t think we would have enough time, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 12, 2025: Based on feedback from our M3, we added live updates through push notifications with Firebase. Every time a new discount is pushed by a grocery store, users subscribed to discount updates will receive a push notification about the discount.
- February 26, 2025: Another change was made to the preferences option for "Manage Trip." This feature has been de-scoped for the MVP, so it is not included, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 27, 2025: Several changes were made to the databases. The new databases we now have are: geonames, route_data, food_data and discounts. The purpose of the geonames database is to store all cities with a population greater than 15,000 people in order to generate routes to these cities. We switched to this approach instead of using an API, as the API was unreliable and the server was often down. We also decided to remove the users database since we de-scoped preferences. It seemed better to separate routes and recipes for portability. Additionally, we got rid of the groceries database and now use the recipes database for ingredients.

**M5:**
- March 16, 2025
    - Section 2: added more clarity of virtual trips and removed descoped features(social media)
    - Section 3.1: Updated use case diagram to more accurately reflect relationships between use cases (View Recipes must use View Past Trips, Manage Groceries must use View Recipes.)
    - Section 3.2: Updated actor to better reflect new usecases
    - Section 3.3: Updated functional requirements to provide more details into success and failure scenarios as well as account for modified use cases
    - Section 3.5: Updated non-functional requirements to better fit the needs of our app and what is feasible
    - Section 4.1: Updated main components to account for use case changes and made function interfaces clearer
    - Section 4.2: Updated databases to fit the changed use cases
    - Section 4.3: Updated external modules to describe ones that provided the nessecary components needed to fulfill use cases
    - Section 4.4: Likewise updated frameworks to reflect changes in use cases
    - Section 4.6: Updated sequence diagrams to reflect every main use case and to follow REST call structure
    - Section 4.7: Updated to reflect non-functional requirement changes
- March 21, 2025
    - These updates happened after the mutual handoff, and thus should not be considered if referenced by code review
    - Section 3.5: After discussion with instructors, updates sources and added brief explanations after each source
    - Section 4.7: Updated description of Non-Functional Requirements testing to accurately reflect the tests performed
    - Section 4.8: Updated main complexity description and pseudocode to reflect expected functionality for final release
    - Section 2: Updated project description to match the scope of the functional requirements.

**M6:**
- March 30, 2025: Section 3.5: Use 3 seconds as the required response times to match test implementation.
- April 2, 2025:
    - Section 4.2 with new sequence diagrams for manage discounts and set preferences to match implementation.
    - Section 3.5: Use 2 seconds as the required response time to match test and provide source justifying.
    - Section 3.1: Invert arrow between "View Past Trips" and "View Recipes" to reflect implementation change.
    - Section 4.7: Update description to match test implementation.
    - Section 4.8: Update main complexity to match implementation and add images.


## 2. Project Description
FoodTrip is an Android app that helps users explore global cuisines by planning a virtual food trip. Users can choose a starting and ending location, and the app will generate a travel route with recipes from different locations along the way. It also creates a grocery list that compiles ingredients from all recipes, making it easier for users to shop, and displays available discounts for the ingredients. Additionally, users can set preferences such as allergies and subscribe to notifications about new discounts as soon as they are posted.

### **3.4. Screen Mockups**
Not necessary to explain our requirements.


### **3.5. Non-Functional Requirements**
<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Efficient performance**
    - **Description**: All endpoints and especially those used for generaing virtual routes and their corresponding recipes should provide a response with relevant information in under 2 seconds.
    - **Justification**: Fast response times are important for maintaining user engagement and preventing frustration. Studies and industry guidelines suggest that delays beyond 2 seconds can lead to noticeable dissatisfaction and reduced interaction.
        - https://odown.com/blog/what-is-a-good-api-response-time/ (for web applications strive for response times under 2 seconds and for mobile applications, aim for 1-3 seconds)
2. **Usability**
    - **Description**: Users should be able to navigate and finish any use case within 3 clicks, if assuming all parameter filling counts as 1 click
    - **Justification**: A simple and easy-to-use app can give users a user-friendly experience. An over-complicated interface will make user confused and frustrated. Tasks exceeding 3 clicks are perceived as more difficult, but are acceptable as long as the flow of information is consistent, hence why parameter filling is counted as a single click
        - https://aisel.aisnet.org/mwais2016/2/ (flow of information is a better heuristic for longer tasks, in practice there the 3 click rule is not as strongly related to usability as expected)
        - https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/121349 (increasing number of clicks tends to increase perceived difficulty, but is not directly related to failure rates)

### **4.2. Databases**
1. **Route Data**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all generated routes by users with information about the start location, end location and number of stops.
2. **Preferences**
    - **Purpose**: Store all information about user food preferences such as allergies.
3. **Discount**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all information about discounts posted by grocery stores and firebase tokens of users who have subscribed to notifications about new discounts.
4. **Recipes**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all previous recipes including their ingredients and steps to complete.

### **4.3. External Modules**
1. **Edamam API**
    - **Purpose**: Used to lookup recipes. Chosen for its ability to lookup 2.3 million recipes and 30 day free trial, as well as being utilized in other similar use cases requiring recipe lookup
2. **OpenStreetMap API**
    - **Purpose**: Used to determine the coordinates of the start and end location. Chosen because of its ease of use (simple city name query), and because it requires no API keys, simplifying its use.
3. **Firebase Cloud Messaging**
    - **Purpose**: Used to set up notifications for alerting users when grocery items are discounted. It was chosen due to allowing implementation of push notifications for android with no monetary cost.
4. **GeoNames database**
    - **Purpose**: Used for a dataset of all cities around the world with a population of 15,000 or more. Selected because it has information about each city including the name, country code, coordinates and population. We chose to use the database rather than API since the API was unreliable and was often unreachable.


### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **AWS**
    - **Purpose**: EC2 Instance
    - **Reason**: All team members have prior experience with AWS from M1. We are also familiar with setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the backend whenever changes are made to the main branch.
2. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Databases
    - **Reason**: All team members have experience working with MongoDB, and it is an approved framework for the project. We also have hands-on experience from tutorials on setting up the database and integrating it with our backend.
3. **Node.js & Express**
    - **Purpose**: Backend API
    - **Reason**: All members are familiar with it, and it meets the project requirements. It also integrates well with MongoDB.

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [Efficient performance](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: Performance is measured through targeted endpoint testing. Routes, recipes, and allergies are tested individually, while discounts and notifications undergo batch testing with up to 10 sequential requests. Response times are tracked from initiation to teardown, providing insights into both general system latency and user-experienced delays for creation, retrieval, and deletion actions.
2. [Usability](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: Front end tests developed with espresso will ensure that all relevant use cases can be navigated to and finished within 3 clicks, if all parameter population is counted as a singular click. This is tested by navigating to all resources and tracking each click used with a custom click action.

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Generate Recipes and Route**
- **Description**: Converts a virtual trip from a pair of city names and number of stops into a list of recipes. More specifically, it takes a pair of strings and an integer, converts the strings into a route (series of coordinates) by using great circle interpolation and the Haversine formula. The algorithm then searches for large cities near the route using a database of cities with a population greater than 15,000. Recipes for each city are found by extracting the name of the city from the route and querying the Edamam API. The user may specify dietary restrictions, which are applied when selecting recipes along the path.
- **Why complex?**:
    - **Math Complexity**: The algorithm must compute an optimal route using great circle interpolation, which involves spherical trigonometry to determine evenly spaced points along the route. The Haversine formula is then used to calculate distances between these points and candidate cities, ensuring that only relevant cities are selected (cities with large enough population). Additionally, geospatial queries are required to efficiently search for cities within a given radius, requiring the use of a spatially indexed database.

    </div>

    - **Recipe Selection and Allergen Filtering**: Once cities are identified along the route, recipes must be retrieved and filtered based on user dietary restrictions. This process involves handling multiple constraints, such as ensuring that the required number of recipes is available while avoiding allergens. The complexity arises from the fact that removing certain recipes due to allergens may lead to insufficient options, requiring alternate cities or a reevaluation of the path. If suitable recipes are not found or if allergens exclude too many options, the system prompts the user to try another path or adjust their dietary preferences.
- **Design**:
    - **Input**:
      - `start`: The name of the city to begin at
      - `destination`: The name of the city to end at
      - `num_stops`: The number of stops to take between start and destination city (`num_stops` + 2 = `num_dishes`)
      - `userID`: A user ID to store the trip under and check for allergies
    - **Output**: A list of recipes associated with the virtual path between input points, avoiding recipes that include ingredients that are listed under the user's allergens.
    - **Main computational logic**:
      - Utilize a database of cities (population > 15,000) indexed by coordinates.
      - Use the Haversine formula to determine distances and great circle interpolation to find intermediate route points.
      - Identify the largest nearby cities (population > 50,000) along the route.
      - Query the Edamam API for recipes associated with each city.
      - Filter recipes based on user dietary restrictions.
    - **Pseudo-code**:
        ```
        final_route = null
        recipes = []
        allergies = []

        if (have_allergies(userID)) {
            allergies = get_allergies(userID)
        }

        route = interpolate_route(start, num_stops, destination)
        cities = find_cities_along_route(route)

        for city in cities {
            potential_recipes = find_recipes_for_city(city)
            no_allergen_recipes = filter_recipes(potential_recipes, allergies)
            
            if (no_allergen_recipes.length > 0) {
                recipes.add(no_allergen_recipes[0])
            }
        }

        if (recipes.length < num_tops + 2) {
            return ("Not enough suitable recipes found, please try adjusting your preferences.", null)
        }

        return (recipes, final_route)
        ```
