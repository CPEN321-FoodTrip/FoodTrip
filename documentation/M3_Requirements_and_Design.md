# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
**M4:**
- February 12, 2025: We modified our use cases to the following: Manage Trip, View Past Trips, View Recipes, View Groceries, Manage Account and Manage Discounts.
The reason for changing our diagram is based on comments from our M3. We also removed the "Share on Social Media" use case for the MVP since we didnâ€™t think we would have enough time, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 12, 2025: Based on feedback from our M3, we added live updates through push notifications with Firebase. Every time a new discount is pushed by a grocery store, users subscribed to discount updates will receive a push notification about the discount.
- February 26, 2025: Another change was made to the preferences option for "Manage Trip." This feature has been de-scoped for the MVP, so it is not included, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 27, 2025: Several changes were made to the databases. The new databases we now have are: geonames, route_data, food_data and discounts. The purpose of the geonames database is to store all cities with a population greater than 15,000 people in order to generate routes to these cities. We switched to this approach instead of using an API, as the API was unreliable and the server was often down. We also decided to remove the users database since we de-scoped preferences. It seemed better to separate routes and recipes for portability. Additionally, we got rid of the groceries database and now use the recipes database for ingredients.  

**M5:**
- March 16, 2025
    - Section 2: added more clarity of virtual trips and removed descoped features(social media)
    - Section 3.1: Updated use case diagram to more accurately reflect relationships between use cases (View Recipes must use View Past Trips, Manage Groceries must use View Recipes.)
    - Section 3.2: Updated actor to better reflect new usecases
    - Section 3.3: Updated functional requirements to provide more details into success and failure scenarios as well as account for modified use cases
    - Section 3.5: Updated non-functional requirements to better fit the needs of our app and what is feasible
    - Section 4.1: Updated main components to account for use case changes and made function interfaces clearer
    - Section 4.2: Updated databases to fit the changed use cases
    - Section 4.3: Updated external modules to describe ones that provided the nessecary components needed to fulfill use cases
    - Section 4.4: Likewise updated frameworks to reflect changes in use cases
    - Section 4.6: Updated sequence diagrams to reflect every main use case and to follow REST call structure
    - Section 4.7: Updated to reflect non-functional requirement changes

## 2. Project Description
FoodTrip is an android app that helps users explore global cuisines by planning a virtual food trip. Users can choose a starting and ending country, and the app will generate a travel route with recipes from different locations along the way. It also creates a smart grocery list which can be used to optimize ingredient reuse and allow users to see local store discounts. Additionally, FoodTrip allows dietary preference customization and social media sharing, so users can tailor their meals to their needs and share their journeys with friends.

### **4.2. Databases**
1. **Route Data**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all generated routes by users with information about the start location, end location and number of stops.
2. **Preferences**
    - **Purpose**: Store all information about user food preferences such as allergies.
3. **Discount**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all information about discounts posted by grocery stores and firebase tokens of users who have subscribed to notifications about new discounts.
4. **Recipes**
    - **Purpose**: Stores all previous recipes including their ingredients and steps to complete.

### **4.3. External Modules**
1. **Edamam API** 
    - **Purpose**: Used to lookup recipes. Chosen for its ability to lookup 2.3 million recipes and 30 day free trial, as well as being utilized in other similar use cases requiring recipe lookup
2. **OpenStreetMap API**
    - **Purpose**: Used to determine the coordinates of the start and end location. Chosen because of its ease of use (simple city name query), and because it requires no API keys, simplifying its use. 
3. **Firebase Cloud Messaging** 
    - **Purpose**: Used to set up notifications for alerting users when grocery items are discounted. It was chosen due to allowing implementation of push notifications for android with no monetary cost.
4. **GeoNames database**
    - **Purpose**: Used for a dataset of all cities around the world with a population of 15,000 or more. Selected because it has information about each city including the name, country code, coordinates and population. We chose to use the database rather than API since the API was unreliable and was often unreachable.


### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **AWS**
    - **Purpose**: EC2 Instance
    - **Reason**: All team members have prior experience with AWS from M1. We are also familiar with setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the backend whenever changes are made to the main branch.
2. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Databases
    - **Reason**: All team members have experience working with MongoDB, and it is an approved framework for the project. We also have hands-on experience from tutorials on setting up the database and integrating it with our backend.
3. **Node.js & Express**
    - **Purpose**: Backend API
    - **Reason**: All members are familiar with it, and it meets the project requirements. It also integrates well with MongoDB.

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [Efficient performance](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: Extensive testing using multiple large concurrent requests(8 simultaneous requests of 21 stops each) and usage of jest functions to see how long each stage of processing takes (stages would be submitting inputs, creating route, and selecting recipes)
2. [Usability](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: Front end tests developed with monkeys and espresso will ensure that all relevant use cases can be navigated to and finished within 3 clicks

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Generate Recipes and Route**
- **Description**: Converts a virtual trip from a pair of city names into a list of recipes. Formally, it takes a pair of strings and an integer, converts the strings into a route(series of coordinates) by via ~ API, then searches for the names of cities nearby. After cities are found, recipes for each city is found by extracting the name of the city from the route and quering through Edamam API. The user may specify dietary restrictions, which would be relevant as it may arbitrarily restrict the recipes that are associated with the selected virtual path
- **Why complex?**: Since virtually trips are meant to be somewhat feasible to physically travel, many different paths could be taken depending on the forms of transportation available, meaning that there are many different viable virtual paths. For any given virtual path, the algorithm must be able to determine what recipes are associated with that path, and then find a combination of recipes that satisfies the number of dishes whilst obeying user dietary restrictions
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: start, The name of the city to begin at
                destination, The name of the city to end at
                total_dishes, the number of dishes for the trip
                dietary_restrictions, a list of ingredients to avoid
    - **Output**: a list of recipes associated with the virtual path between input points
    - **Main computational logic**: ...
    - **Pseudo-code**: ...
        ```
        final_route = null
        recipes = []
        countries = []
        while (attemptedpaths < attempt_limit) // to prevent insane delays from trying every possible path
            route = find_route(start, destination)
            cities = find_cities_from_route(route)
            for city in cities
                potential_recipes = find_recipes_for_city(route,city)
                remove_violating_recipes(potential_recipes, dietary_restrictions)
                if potential_recipes.length < total_dishes
                    continue // try another path
                selected_recipes = select_recipes(potential_recipes, total_dishes)
                recipes.add(selected_recipes)
                final_route = route
            attemptedpaths++
        return(recipes,final_route)
        ```
