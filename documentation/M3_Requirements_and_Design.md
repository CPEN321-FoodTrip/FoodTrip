# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
- February 12, 2025: We modified our use cases to the following: Manage Trip, View Past Trips, View Recipes, View Groceries, Manage Account and Manage Discounts. The updated use-case diagram is:  
![Use-Case Diagram](images/use-case-diagram-v2.png)  
The reason for changing our diagram is based on comments from our M3. We also removed the "Share on Social Media" use case for the MVP since we didnâ€™t think we would have enough time, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 12, 2025: Based on feedback from our M3, we added live updates through push notifications with Firebase. Every time a new discount is pushed by a grocery store, users subscribed to discount updates will receive a push notification about the discount.
- February 26, 2025: Another change was made to the preferences option for "Manage Trip." This feature has been de-scoped for the MVP, so it is not included, however, we will try to add this functionality in the final version of the app.
- February 27, 2025: Several changes were made to the databases. The new databases we now have are: geonames, route_data, food_data and discounts. The purpose of the geonames database is to store all cities with a population greater than 15,000 people in order to generate routes to these cities. We switched to this approach instead of using an API, as the API was unreliable and the server was often down. We also decided to remove the users database since we de-scoped preferences. It seemed better to separate routes and recipes for portability. Additionally, we got rid of the groceries database and now use the recipes database for ingredients.
- March 4, 2025: While PRs were created for firebase notifications, unfortunately this feature could not be complete for the MVP. Similarly for the frontend aspect of viewing recipes, the feature could not be complete for the MVP as well as viewing past routes on the map, even though backend endpoints are set up.

## 2. Project Description
FoodTrip is an android app that helps users explore global cuisines by planning a virtual food trip. Users can choose a starting and ending country, and the app will generate a travel route with recipes from different locations along the way. It also creates a smart grocery list which can be used to optimize ingredient reuse and allow users to see local store discounts. Additionally, FoodTrip allows dietary preference customization and social media sharing, so users can tailor their meals to their needs and share their journeys with friends.

### **3.5. Non-Functional Requirements**
<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Efficient performance**
    - **Description**: The system should generate food trips and grocery lists in under 10 seconds.

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [Efficient performance](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: The system will use caching and asynchronous processing to improve response times. Frequently accessed data will be cached to reduce redundant computations, and background tasks will handle complex operations without blocking user interactions.
2. [Scalability](#nfr1)
    - **Cloud Computing**: The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud services and thus be able to dynamically scale to meet the needs of users. Recipes will be stored by name or ID on a MongoDB database, thus reducing their overall size from the entire recipe to just a list of strings, thus drastically reducing the size of recipes

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**[Convert_Virtual_Trip]**
- **Description**: Converts a virtual trip from google maps into a list of ingredients. Formally, it takes a pair of coordinates and finds a combination of transportation methods between those points via google maps. Must be able to associate the path travelled to certain ethnic foods, then search for recipes for said food through edamam API, finally returning a series of recipes that an individual may reasonably find if they were to actually travel between the two inputs points. A dish would be considered reasonable if the region associated with it is within a certain distance of a virtual path between the points as given by google maps. The user may specify dietary restrictions and the number of subcultures within a given country, which would be relevant as it may arbitrarily restrict the recipes that are associated with the selected virtual path
- **Why complex?**: Since users are expected to travel across multiple countries, many different paths could be taken depending on the forms of transportation available, meaning that there are many different viable virtual paths. For any given virtual path, the algorithm must be able to determine what recipes are associated with that path, and then find a combination of recipes that satisfies the number of dishes per country whilst obeying user dietary restrictions
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: firstpoint, The starting location of the virtual trip
                secondpoint, The end location of the virtual trip
                stops_per_country, the number of dishes to select per country
                 dietary_restrictions, a list of ingredients to avoid
    - **Output**: a list of recipes associated with the virtual path between input points
    - **Main computational logic**: ...
    - **Pseudo-code**: ...
        ```
        attempted_paths = 0
        viable_routes = []
        recipes = []
        countries = []
        while (attemptedpaths < attempt_limit) // to prevent insane delays from trying every possible path
            route = find_route(firstpoint, secondpoint)
            countries = find_countries_from_route(route)
            for country in countries
                potential_recipes = find_recipes_for_country(route,country,relevance_distance)
                remove_violating_recipes(potential_recipes, dietary_restrictions)
                if potential_recipes.length < stops_per_country
                    continue // try another path
                selected_recipes = select_recipes(potential_recipes, stops_per_country, subcultures_per_country)
                recipes.add(selected_recipes)
                viable_routes.add(route)
            attemptedpaths++
        return(recipes,viable_routes)
        ```
